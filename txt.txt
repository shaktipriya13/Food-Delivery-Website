# how to pen browser: write in terminal
# 1. cd myapp
# 2. npm start

# vimp note: In JSX, component names must be capitalized. 

come into folder my app & write "npm start"
//this will run react application in browser

we don't touch src & public folder in 90%cases

App.js me jo bhi ha wo apko browser me dikhega

1. ReactDOM.render() controls the contents of the container node you pass in.Currently returns a refernce to the root ReactComponent instance.
delete index.css,app.css,logo.svg, reportWebVitals.js & app.test.js from src folder

# to write inline CSS, use js code & treat ur css as an object of JS

2. our first component in React.JS:
3 things are mandatory and that are:
1> import React from "react"
2>any 1 function(functional component)
3>it should always return JSX

# note: 2 components in react can't have same name

# note for using JSX
# 1. it always uses a single elmnt..only 1 main div acn be there
# 2. use div/main/section/article or React fragment to wrap all ur JSX Code
# best is to use React Fragment
# small format of React Fragment  <> text</> ..ie. only opening & closing tag
# 3. in react , we hv to use ClassName in place of class for applying css
# 4. in JSX, we hv to close every opeing tag, even img tag:
eg: <img src="" alt=""></img> or
<img src="" alt="" />
# 5. use camelCase for attribute names having more than 1 word
# 6. component name first letter keep capital
# function ko react me component kehte ha


//to deal with images in react: open image in new tab, copy link and paste directly.eg:
<img src="https://vegecravings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Vegetable-Masala-Maggi-Recipe-Step-By-Step-Instructions-scaled.jpg" alt="images" className="card-media" />

note: useState Hooks is used to store and hold data with it for sometime
useState returns an array of 2 elmnts
useState is used to manage the data in React application

using Props we can follow "DRY" principle rule

//to host react website , first make a build folder..type command "npm run build" in terminal
